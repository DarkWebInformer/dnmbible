      <description>Important tips for using markets   NEVER let the market encrypt sensitive data (such as your address) for you. Always encrypt it yourself. The market can always store the plaintext version of your message, and send an encrypted one to the vendor. That way you both think it was encrypted while the market still has the original and unencrypted message. Also if the market gets taken over by law enforcement, they will store the plaintext versions of the messages that the users sent using the &amp;lsquo;PGP encrypt&amp;rsquo; checkbox to harvest addresses.</description>

It is important to do your own homework about different markets, and vendors.

Instead you can check out the Superlist It has a lot of different markets that have been around for some time, and have shown to be more reliable.</description>

      <description>Getting a lawyer If you get in legal trouble Note: this mainly applies to americans. In other countries, such as the UK it can be different and for example remaining silent could be used against you. So make sure you research the legal situation in your country on your own too.  If you ever encounter law enforcement due to serious issues (e.g. a controlled delivery) say nothing. Shut the fuck up.</description>

      <description>Giving Feedback Tips Giving feedback and rating a vendor is just as important as escrow or multi-sig. It is your voice to the vendor and any future patrons of that vendors business. Rating a vendor and leaving feedback should be taken seriously. It&amp;rsquo;s truly the only means of regulating how business is conducted and it&amp;rsquo;s what maintains the purity of products you find on the markets. The combined feedback and ratings left by customers is paramount when choosing a vendor.</description>

      <description>IRL OpSec General This chapter is about how to keep your OpSec tight in areas that are not primarily related to DNMs. It includes for example reselling (since few of your friends would probably be willing to set up Tails just to communicate with you).
Keep your mouth shut
The golden rule is to never tell anybody where you get your products from. Period. No exceptions. Even if a long time friend is nagging you to tell him who you get that dank shit from, do not give in the temptation to tell him about your elaborate DNM setup and how you import drugs in bulk.</description>
