      <description>Origin Countries The first rule is: stick to domestic whenever possible. Mail that does not cross any country border will get far less checked than all other mail. This reduces the risk of you not getting your package or even getting in legal trouble.
However one disadvantage is that the prices can be a bit higher compared to other listings from vendors that ship not from your country. You have to decide for yourself if you want to take the higher risk and pay a bit less or if you want to play it safe and pay a bit more.</description>

      <title>Stealth</title>

      <description>Stealth Stealth is important to get your ordered product to your front door. It is mainly a vendor topic (because they have to package the order) but you have to pay attention to it too, in order to avoid getting into legal trouble because you chose a vendor who is known for his bad stealth.
The important difference between stealth and decoy is that stealth is used to make the pack appear as normal as possible and also conceal the smell of the drugs.</description>

      <title>Non arriving Packages</title>

      <description>Non arriving packages General Keep in mind that some vendors mark your order shipped before they actually ship it (for security reasons and/or because they are lazy). So do not expect that they actually shipped your order out when it got marked shipped.
There can also be a lot of other reasons why your package is late (e.g. weather, postal strike, . . .), so please be patient.
Testing if your mail gets intercepted To test if your mail gets intercepted you can mail yourself something (preferably from a post office as far away from you as possible).</description>

      <title>Drop</title>

      <description>Drop Regardless of where you choose to get your order delivered to, always have a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; house when you are expecting a package. That means do not have any illegal or suspicious things (like a bong) in your house or any other locations tied to your identity. That is because if something goes wrong, your properties will get searched. If law enforcement then finds illegal things, it is much harder to argue in front of the court that you are a perfectly law abiding citizen who knows nothing about the drugs that someone sent to his address.</description>

      <title>Controlled Delivery (CD)</title>
      <link>http://biblemeowimkh3utujmhm6oh2oeb3ubjw2lpgeq3lahrfr2l6ev6zgyd.onion/bible/shipping/controlled_delivery/</link>

      <description>Controlled Delivery (CD) What is a Controlled Delivery? This is an attempt to accept a package containing drugs to obtain a solid reason for a search of your home to be conducted. They get you to accept the package and they believe that this is reasonable cause to believe you ordered the package and knew it was coming. Just because a package requires a signature does not mean it is in anyway a CD.</description>

      <title>Monitored Delivery</title>
      <link>http://biblemeowimkh3utujmhm6oh2oeb3ubjw2lpgeq3lahrfr2l6ev6zgyd.onion/bible/shipping/monitored_delivery/</link>

      <description>Monitored Delivery What is a Monitored Delivery? Unlike a controlled delivery, a monitored delivery is a much rarer practice and occurs when law enforcement knowingly delivers drugs to you and then puts you under surveillance to gain evidence to further their investigation of your illegal activities in order to build a bigger case against you. This can continue over several months. That way law enforcement is able to build strong cases against suspects even if their OpSec is tight.</description>

      <title>Love Letter</title>
      <link>http://biblemeowimkh3utujmhm6oh2oeb3ubjw2lpgeq3lahrfr2l6ev6zgyd.onion/bible/shipping/love_letter/</link>

      <description>Love letter A &amp;ldquo;love letter&amp;rdquo; is a playful name for a letter from the postal services which basically states:
 We seized your goodies, but don&amp;rsquo;t have the time/money to build up a case against you; and/or you didn&amp;rsquo;t order enough for us to be too concerned. You lucked out bastard. Don&amp;rsquo;t do it again, we are watching your address. Sincerely, LEO/Post Office/Postal Inspector
 International Seizure Letters Customs agencies around the world, including US Customs, frequently send &amp;ldquo;love letter&amp;rdquo; seizure notices to recipients of international mail with small amounts of suspected illegal drugs inside.</description>
