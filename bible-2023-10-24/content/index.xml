      <description>Creating a PGP key pair When you create a PGP key pair, it gives you two unique keys: a public key, and a private key. You are to not, at any times, or for any reason, to give anyone your private key. That is for your eyes only. Your public key, however, is able to be given out so others can encrypt messages with your public key, send them to you, and then only YOU can decrypt them with your private key.</description>

      <description>Origin Countries The first rule is: stick to domestic whenever possible. Mail that does not cross any country border will get far less checked than all other mail. This reduces the risk of you not getting your package or even getting in legal trouble.
However one disadvantage is that the prices can be a bit higher compared to other listings from vendors that ship not from your country. You have to decide for yourself if you want to take the higher risk and pay a bit less or if you want to play it safe and pay a bit more.</description>

      <title>Important tips for using markets</title>
      <link>http://biblemeowimkh3utujmhm6oh2oeb3ubjw2lpgeq3lahrfr2l6ev6zgyd.onion/bible/darknetmarkets/important_tips/</link>

      <description>Important tips for using markets   NEVER let the market encrypt sensitive data (such as your address) for you. Always encrypt it yourself. The market can always store the plaintext version of your message, and send an encrypted one to the vendor. That way you both think it was encrypted while the market still has the original and unencrypted message. Also if the market gets taken over by law enforcement, they will store the plaintext versions of the messages that the users sent using the &amp;lsquo;PGP encrypt&amp;rsquo; checkbox to harvest addresses.</description>

      <description>Monero FAQ How do I safely route my coins? Exchange -&amp;gt; Monero wallet (on Tails or Whonix) -&amp;gt; Destination
More details in the following posts: 1, 2
My vendor only accepts Bitcoin, what do I do? Monero wallet -&amp;gt; Exchange service -&amp;gt; Destination or Monero wallet -&amp;gt; Exchange service -&amp;gt; Bitcoin wallet -&amp;gt; Destination
Use an instant exchange service over Tor to anonymously convert your Monero into Bitcoin.
Avoid sending directly from an exchange service to the destination if your order has a short timeout.</description>

      <description>Converting your coins Converting your coins is a very straight forward process. The goal for everyone should always be to use Monero (XMR) if you cannot start with Monero you can purchase Litecoin or Bitcoin, and swap them for Monero.
Once you have your starting coins, you can visit [https://kycnot.me] or you can also visit our sister XMR guide. [http://xmrguide25ibknxgaray5rqksrclddxqku3ggdcnzg4ogdi5qkdkd2yd.onion] Both have a list of of exchangers you can use.</description>

      <description>Creating a KeePassXC database Before creating a new database make sure that you have set up and unlocked the persistent volume.  On the welcome screen, click on &amp;lsquo;Create new database&amp;rsquo;. Alternatively, click on &amp;ldquo;Database&amp;rdquo; in the menu bar -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;New database&amp;rdquo;.
Make sure you save the database on the persistent volume. If you fail to do this your database will be gone when you restart Tails.
  You will now enter your master password.</description>

      <description>Email Note: Email providers, especially those run by anonymous people (as most .onion email providers are), can go offline at any time. This happened a lot in the past and will happen in the future too. So make sure you always back up the emails you want to keep and do not have important accounts tied to these email addresses (e.g. 2FA for a valuable Bitcoin trading account).  In order to use email securely to communicate you have to pay attention to the following points:</description>

      <description>Impotant information Before we continute it is important to understand why it is important not to use Windows or Mac. Many people assume they can run Whonix in virtual box, and be secure. While most of you would be fine running windows with Tor that is not the purpose of this guide.
Windows, and Mac are loaded with backdoors, and both are companies that WILL cooperate with law enforcement.
This guide is written to help keep you safe, and secure.</description>

      <description>How to verify an onion address Verifying onions. It&amp;rsquo;s such an important thing yet so many people don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do it properly. Always, regardless of where you get the onion from take the time to verify it. You never know when you have a typo, or a simple error. Taking the 10 seconds to verify can save your coins from falling to a phisher.
Darkfail has a great tool to help you do it, but no one resource should be blindly trusted.</description>

      <description>Important tips regarding Bitcoin  SAVE YOUR ELECTRUM SEED. Write it down on a sheet of paper, in a text file and/or remember it. Just make sure that you still have access to it if you loose your Tails USB stick. Then you will always be able to recover all your bitcoins. Do I have to do something in order to receive bitcoins? No, you just need to send the bitcoins to one of the addresses under the &amp;ldquo;Addresses&amp;rdquo; tab.</description>

      <description>Importing a public key To be able to send someone an encrypted message (e.g. your address to a vendor), you need their public key. In order to get a vendor&amp;rsquo;s public key you have to visit his profile and look out for a link that is named like &amp;ldquo;PGP key&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Vendor public key&amp;rdquo;. Sometimes it is also featured directly on the vendor&amp;rsquo;s profile page.
A public key looks like this:</description>

      <description>Installing the host OS To be able to run Whonix, you must first choose and install the host OS, on which you will later run Whonix. Like a program that you run on an OS, only that the program in this case is a full OS itself.
As mentioned at the beginning, if you are not that tech-savvy you should use Manjaro, Debian, or Linux Mint. Just follow these instructions for Debian, or these for manjaro and these When installing make sure you are fully encrypting your device or you&amp;rsquo;re not securing your host OS!</description>

      <description>Javascript warnings If you have javascript on you have probably gotten a warning on a few different sites by now. Javascript is not naturally dangerous, but it can be used in different situations to deanonymize who you are.
Again this is why we say keep your darknet activities, and clearnet completely separate. Certain websites can use javascript to see what your real IP address is behind tor.
Disabling javascript Note: You will need to do this everytime you restart tails!</description>

      <description>Multisignature (Multisig) Markets For the sake of keeping this simple we are going to be talking mostly about 2/3 Multisig. The number simply refers to the number of keys that are required. So what is multisig? Multisig stands for multi-signature. This means that multiple approvals (signatures) are needed before a transaction is confirmed.
Although already present in other industries, the concept was first applied to Bitcoin addresses in 2012, which led to the creation of multisig wallets and even pure multisig markets like for example Hansa, CGMC, Cannahome or Versus.</description>

      <description>Stealth Stealth is important to get your ordered product to your front door. It is mainly a vendor topic (because they have to package the order) but you have to pay attention to it too, in order to avoid getting into legal trouble because you chose a vendor who is known for his bad stealth.
The important difference between stealth and decoy is that stealth is used to make the pack appear as normal as possible and also conceal the smell of the drugs.</description>

      <description>Choosing a Darknet Market Choosing a market can be very overwhelming. More and more markets come out everyday. It is important to do your own homework about different markets, and vendors. Making constant posts on /d/DarknetMarkets asking &amp;ldquo;Which market is the best right now?&amp;rdquo; will just leave you getting results from market shills or others trying to phish you. Instead you can check out the Superlist It has a lot of different markets that have been around for some time, and have shown to be more reliable.</description>

      <description>Customizing the settings The last step you have to take in order to finish your OB setup is customizing the settings a little bit. To get there go to your &amp;ldquo;Home&amp;rdquo; tab and click on the &amp;ldquo;Customize&amp;rdquo; button. Then switch to the &amp;ldquo;General&amp;rdquo; tab located on the left side and set the option &amp;ldquo;Display Mature Content&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;. Click on the &amp;ldquo;Save&amp;rdquo; button again.
Then jump to the &amp;ldquo;Store&amp;rdquo; tab and set the option &amp;ldquo;Store&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Off&amp;rdquo; since you are not a vendor and want to keep your attack surface as low as possible.</description>

      <description>Encrypting a message with PGP You must always encrypt sensitive information yourself. Never trust a market to do it for you.  Tails You first need to import the public key of the user (e.g. a vendor) that you want to message, so you can encrypt messages that you want to send to him.   First open Kleopatra. Click Notepad in Kleopatra Type or paste your message into the text area Now click the Recipients tabs    Uncheck sign as If you want to be able to read this message in the future make sure you check &amp;ldquo;Encrypt for me&amp;rdquo; and select the name of your key.</description>

      <description>Escrow In standard escrow the market holds the money during the purchase. They are typically the most common types of market you will find. You send your coins to the market controlled wallet. If you received your order you tell the market to finalize your order and give the vendor your money.
Be careful: the orders finalize after some time automatically, in case you forgot to do it manually and so that the vendor has not to wait ages for his money.</description>

      <description>How to buy bitcoins The best method to buy btc is to not reveal your identity. Unfortunately most major btc exchanges require ID, or ones that will keep you anonymous have very high fees. If you have to use your ID, or are just buying with a card that is attached to your real identity it is okay. We will be covering how to break the chain of custody to your identity by converting to Monero later on.</description>

      <description>Installing Whonix Installing Before you install Whonix, a small note that it consists of two different OS: the Gateway and the Workstation. When you set everything up you do all your work (like using the Tor browser, decrypting PGP messages, . . .) on the Workstation. The Workstation contacts the Gateway in the background (i.e. you do not have to do anything) and sends the entire internet traffic that you produce on the Workstation to it.</description>

      <description>Non arriving packages General Keep in mind that some vendors mark your order shipped before they actually ship it (for security reasons and/or because they are lazy). So do not expect that they actually shipped your order out when it got marked shipped.
There can also be a lot of other reasons why your package is late (e.g. weather, postal strike, . . .), so please be patient.
Testing if your mail gets intercepted To test if your mail gets intercepted you can mail yourself something (preferably from a post office as far away from you as possible).</description>

      <description>Practice verifying Lets practice so you can see what it will look like when you verify an onion!
PGP key First import the bibles pgp key from the /pgp.txt page
Your onion should look like this: http://biblemeowimkh3utujmhm6oh2oeb3ubjw2lpgeq3lahrfr2l6ev6zgyd.onion/mirrors.txt
Note The first time you import a new pgp key it is good practice to compare the key to multiple places. Most markets will also post their pgp key on the subdread, or you can compare them with other reputable services.</description>

If you already have an XMPP account, like one you use in Pidgin. We will cover how to properly move it to Gajim, and use OMEMO. It is important to note. Like OTR if the person you are trying to communicate with does not have OMEMO installed you will not be able to have a encrypted conersation with them.</description>

      <description>Direct Deal/Finalize Early (FE) Vendors that have been around a very long time sometimes will join Direct deal markets, or have FE status granted to them on an escrow market. Typically these vendors are considered more &amp;ldquo;trust worthy&amp;rdquo;
Most markets now have rules in place that forbid vendors from requesting you FE them if they have not been granted that status. If you get a message asking you to FE from a vendor this should be a big red flag for you.</description>

This should explain the level some phishers will go to try and steal your coins. The users that blindly used these sites could have easily protected their coins by verifying!  If the users that fell for this trap had taken the time to verify their coins would be safe today. Instead many lost all their coins.</description>

      <description>Tumbling Tumbling is a service that has worked well in the past. With the rise of the darknet, tumbling has become more of an outdated service. Many tumblers risk your opsec, or just scam you of your coins. Tumbling your coins is still better than not tumbling them, but they will not protect you. This cannot be stressed enough, chain anylsis can very easily track your coins back to you even if you use a tumbler.</description>

Now enter the username the the other person gave you. I could for example be username99@jabber.calyxinstitute.org. Optionally you can also set an alias for him in the line below which gets shown in the chat window when you chat with that person (instead of the long username which you previously entered).</description>

      <description>Verifying a message with PGP Verifying messages is commonly used to check the authenticity of market links. Markets publish signed messages containing links to their market. If you have the market&amp;rsquo;s public key you can use it to verify that the message was created by the market and that the links are legitimate.
Markets, vendors and moderators will sometimes sign announcements or warnings. You can also use this to verify those.</description>

 Now all you have to do is go to the market site (e.g. registration page or login page) and paste that password there. Your clipboard will automatically clear after 10 seconds, so be quick.</description>

      <description>Choosing a vendor Choosing a vendor to buy your desired product from is an important step and you should take your time for that to avoid trouble later. It can mean the difference between you not getting the product and loosing your money and a successful and flawless purchase.
Tips When you are a new buyer it is best to stick to already established ones because this usually means that you are less likely to run into issues and the vendor knows what he is doing.</description>

      <description>Drop Regardless of where you choose to get your order delivered to, always have a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; house when you are expecting a package. That means do not have any illegal or suspicious things (like a bong) in your house or any other locations tied to your identity. That is because if something goes wrong, your properties will get searched. If law enforcement then finds illegal things, it is much harder to argue in front of the court that you are a perfectly law abiding citizen who knows nothing about the drugs that someone sent to his address.</description>

      <description>Creating and configuring the Persistent Storage Normally Tails forgets every change you made on it when you reboot (that is why it is called amnesiac). However when you want to order from DNMs you need to save some files. This is possible by setting up the persistence volume which encrypt, and store your data after restarting. Tails uses LUKS or, Linux Unified Key Setup to encrypt your data, if you want to know more about LUKS you can read about it here</description>

You may think that 2FA for markets is good (which it is) so it must be good for Electrum on Tails too. No. It requires you to bring your smartphone into DNM activities as well as installing google apps on it which is the last thing you want for an anonymous DNM wallet.

They get you to accept the package and they believe that this is reasonable cause to believe you ordered the package and knew it was coming. Just because a package requires a signature does not mean it is in anyway a CD.</description>

      <description>Sending Bitcoin This chapter deals with sending your bitcoins from the source you got them (e.g. a Bitcoin exchange) to the final destination (a DNM). Unfortunately it is not as easy as sending them straight to your market deposit address because exchanges have banned and flagged accounts in the past that did that.
The Path Note: as described earlier, if you use Electrum an attacker can see what addresses belong to what wallet and which IP address regularly checks the balance of these addresses.</description>

      <description>Monitored Delivery What is a Monitored Delivery? Unlike a controlled delivery, a monitored delivery is a much rarer practice and occurs when law enforcement knowingly delivers drugs to you and then puts you under surveillance to gain evidence to further their investigation of your illegal activities in order to build a bigger case against you. This can continue over several months. That way law enforcement is able to build strong cases against suspects even if their OpSec is tight.</description>

      <description>Transactions not getting confirmed Bitcoin transactions become &amp;ldquo;confirmed&amp;rdquo; when miners accept to write them in the Bitcoin blockchain. In general, the speed of confirmation depends on the fee you attach to your transaction; miners prioritize transaction that pay the highest fees. Another reason could be that the Bitcoin network is overloaded at the moment. Sometimes a lot of unconfirmed transaction rack up (tens of thousands) these have to get processed, which will take a while.</description>

      <description>Giving Feedback Tips Giving feedback and rating a vendor is just as important as escrow or multi-sig. It is your voice to the vendor and any future patrons of that vendors business. Rating a vendor and leaving feedback should be taken seriously. It&amp;rsquo;s truly the only means of regulating how business is conducted and it&amp;rsquo;s what maintains the purity of products you find on the markets. The combined feedback and ratings left by customers is paramount when choosing a vendor.</description>

      <description>IRL OpSec General This chapter is about how to keep your OpSec tight in areas that are not primarily related to DNMs. It includes for example reselling (since few of your friends would probably be willing to set up Tails just to communicate with you).
Keep your mouth shut
The golden rule is to never tell anybody where you get your products from. Period. No exceptions. Even if a long time friend is nagging you to tell him who you get that dank shit from, do not give in the temptation to tell him about your elaborate DNM setup and how you import drugs in bulk.</description>

      <description>Uploading images securely Images can tell the world a lot of information and can even reveal your true identity although you have followed all other steps in the DNM bible. So it is important to read and follow this chapter too because it can literally mean the difference between freedom and jail.
Just do give you an example of what basic forensic video/photo software is capable of doing. Now imagine what forensic software on steroids law enforcement can buy with all their money.</description>

      <description>Before you start So you are about to read how to commit felonies and reduce the risk of getting caught. It is strongly recommended that anything that could be considered Darknet related you don&amp;rsquo;t do on your normal operating system, or default browser. Keep your darknet activity as far away from your real identity as possible. For example your browser could store the visited sites in his history and somebody else sees it when using your computer.</description>

      <description>Frequently Asked Questions Why am I getting Javascript warnings? Read about why here.
Can&amp;rsquo;t I just use a burner phone instead of a secure OS? No. Cell phones are not secure at all. They have a lot of exploits in them. Go on craigslist/ebay whatever buy a laptop that is a few years old. It does not need to be anything special or expensive.
Do I really need to convert my coins if I&amp;rsquo;m only buying personal amounts?</description>
